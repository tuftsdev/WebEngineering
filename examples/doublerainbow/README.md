# Overview
This was created by Rachel Sulmonte, who was a high school student at the time when this was created.  She took my course "Developing Computer and Interactive Media" in summer 2012 at Tufts.  This example applies the ideas of events (in this example, "timeupdate"), event listening, and first-class functions (the callback function inside of `video.addEventListener()`).
