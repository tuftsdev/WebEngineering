# Overview
Examples using (client-side) JavaScript's `XMLHttpRequest` object:
* `whereintheworld.html` - Uses `XMLHttpRequest` to get the JSON data in file`location.json`.  Upon successful retrieval of `location.json` file, the JSON data is parsed into JavaScript object format which can be used to dynamically update the HTML body via Document Object Model (DOM).
* `messages.html` - After successful loading of the page, an HTTP GET request is made to data a remote server `https://ransomware-fyi.herokuapp.com/latest.json` via `XMLHttpRequest`.  Upon receiving a completed response from the server, the JSON data is parsed into JavaScript object format which can be used to dynamically update the HTML body via Document Object Model (DOM).  *IMPORTANT: the resource at https://ransomware-fyi.herokuapp.com/latest.json allows cross-origin requests!*  Try it out at https://tuftsdev.github.io/WebEngineering/examples/ajax/messages.html
