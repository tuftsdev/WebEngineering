# Overview
Examples using (client-side) JavaScript's `XMLHttpRequest` object:
* `whereintheworld.html` - Uses `XMLHttpRequest` to get the JSON data in file`location.json`.  Upon successful retrieval of `location.json` file, the JSON data is parsed into JavaScript object format which can be used to dynamically update the HTML body via Document Object Model (DOM).
* `mbta_stations.html` - After successful loading of the page, an HTTP GET request is made to data a remote server `https://mbta-message-hub.herokuapp.com/latest.json` via `XMLHttpRequest` (new link for spring 2023).  Upon receiving a completed response from the server, the JSON data is parsed into JavaScript object format which can be used to dynamically update the HTML body via Document Object Model (DOM).  *IMPORTANT: the resource at https://mbta-message-hub.herokuapp.com/latest.json allows cross-origin requests!*
