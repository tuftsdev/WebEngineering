# Overview
A few examples using the Document Object Model (DOM).

* `profile.html` - A non-persistent chat-box (like Facebook Messenger).  New messages are appended to last message typed in.
* `fml.html` - A non-persistent blogging web page.  New messages are prepended to last message typed in.
* `fml-prepend.html` - Another way to do `fml.html` but without the ugly string concatenation to previous `.innerHTML`.

# Exercise
Take a look at the `paragraphs-exercise.html`. Write a JavaScript function that when one clicks on "CLICK ME", all the paragraphs on the page are highlighted in yellow and the text of each paragraph is displayed in JavaScript console.

Solution: see `paragraphs.html`
