<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>It goes without saying: the web is an integral part of society and our lives.  As <a href="/~couch">Alva Couch</a> wrote, "web technology is (still) changing at a speed beyond belief and no one, guru or not, can keep up with all the changes."  The web browser has also grown to be a critical piece of software on many platforms: PC, mobile devices, and video game consoles.  This course will follow the course tradition of "looking under the hood," exploring ways to create web content and applications.  Core technologies including HTML / XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL will be emphasized.  Web security will also be discussed.  Finally, this course will delve into modern web development.  Concepts and technologies including Google APIs, Ajax, social networking, mashups, jQuery, and web analytics will be introduced.</p>

<h3>Textbooks</h3>

<p>None.  Look, literally all the information you need is on the web.  I was once a college student and I understand how the cost of textbooks is absolutely outrageous.  Chances are, if I select a single textbook for the course, only a few chapters will be relevant.  Now why would I require my students to buy something for my course that is of questionable value?  However, please refer to the <a href="resources.php">References and Resources</a>.</p>
