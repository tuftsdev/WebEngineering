# Overview
Examples of data persistence using cookies and local storage:

* `cookies_example.html` - An example that sets cookies in (client-side) JavaScript.  After you open the page, take a look at your list of cookies for this site under the settings or preferences of your web browser......
* `localstorage_example.html` - Very similar to the [profile.html](https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/blob/gh-pages/examples/dom/profile.html) example in the `dom` examples folder but all messages are stored in browser's local storage.
